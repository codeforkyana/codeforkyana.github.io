<p>As a new brigade, one of the first things we're doing is thinking of projects that can positively impact the community.</p>

<p><em>We always want to hear about projects that you want to work on with us. We are an organization that will be driven by our community, and we're here to help connect people and build impactful projects. Please come to our meetings to work on existing projects or to bring your own!</em></p>

<p>We will follow Code for America's proven model for building services, which you can read about <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/how">at CodeForAmerica.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>LG&E/KU Power Outage Data</h3>
<p>Since power outages have such a big impact on people, we wanted to make historical power outage information available for analysis. We built a scraper and now publish historical power outage information. <a href="/2019-12-07-power-utility-data/">Read the full announcement.</a></p>

<h2>Planned Projects</h2>

<h3>Renters' Rights</h3>
<h5>Potential Partners</h5>
<a href="https://www.kyequaljustice.org">Kentucky Equal Justice Center</a><br>

<h5>Potential Seed Project</h5>
<a href="https://github.com/codeforsanjose/renters-rights">Code for San Jose's renters-rights app</a>
<p>In our conversations with lawyers and those working in the housing space, we have heard that there is a need for a tool that will help increase renters' knowledge of their right as well as generate documentation and correspondence to their landlords. We would like to work with Kentucky Equal Justice Center and Metropolitan Housing Coalition to build a tool that they could help get in the hands of renters.</p>
