Currently, there are 70+ Brigades across the United States, bringing together community organizers, developers, and designers to use technology to improve the lives of citizens.

Our mission is to <em>organize and advocate for the use of public data and technology to make Louisville and Southern Indiana a more safe, resilient, and equitable place.</em>

<h2>Leadership</h2>
Code for Kentuckiana is governed by a Steering Committee and is led by two steering committee members who have been elected co-captains.
